        <description>So much of what I do and learn is ephemeral. Most of the things I read everyday are only temporarily stored in my brain.
But this changes today.
At least I hope so. Because today I discovered Obsidian. I plan to use this to create my own Knowledge Database by saving articles, learnings, bookmarks, etc. in one repository which I can go back to and refresh my memory.
Another part of improving my learning skills is by writing posts like these.</description>

        <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m trying out this Hugo thing. And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty great! Great documentation and easy to get started with. And the first theme I picked fits me pretty well. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I stick with it.
I intend to use this blog primarily as a tool for myself to keep a journal of my everyday findings and thoughs, and to improve my writing skills.</description>
